# Final-Year-Project

In the current technological climate, mobile devices have become an intrinsic part of how
society functions. There is also an increasing trend and demand for these devices to be
compact. As a result, there is a need for smaller electrical components that can fit
seamlessly into these devices and antennas are an example of such components.

While small antenna design is imperative in the current industry, there is still much
discourse about existing designs as performance degradations arise with the reduction in
the size of the antenna.

This report will provide an insight on the designing of a compact wideband antenna. It will
detail the design and simulation of a novel bowtie dipole antenna that operates within the
Ultra-High frequency band. The antenna will be designed using a software known as High
Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) and the results of the simulations will be presented
and discussed in the following report
